# Welcome to UKMM!

It looks like this is your first time launching the app, or UKMM hasn't been configured yet.

## Before you can use UKMM, you need to:

1. **Choose your platform** - Are you modding the Wii U or Switch version of Breath of the Wild?

2. **Set your game dump path** - UKMM needs to know where your game files are located so it can merge mods correctly.

3. **Configure deployment** - Tell UKMM where to output the merged mods.

## Getting Started

**Head to the Settings tab** up top to configure UKMM. There's a Help button there if you need detailed guidance.

Once configured, you can start installing mods by dragging them into the Mods tab or using the Install tab.
